# Password-Manager-System-Java
Password Manager System is designed to solve the usual problems that users encounter when keeping passwords safe and organized. The design of the system under consideration is extremely oriented at the level of user convenience, and the functional and informational security. It has a menu-driven and modular approach in its design to let the users employ a more rigid structure to achieve a certain goal. Every module is intended for unique operations regarding password management but keeping the same level of interface cohesion.
Key Components
1.	User Interface
•	The system begins with a welcome message to introduce users to its functionalities. This serves as an entry point to ensure users are guided properly.
•	The menu options are displayed prominently, offering a clear list of available features. This minimizes confusion and helps users navigate the system seamlessly.
•	User inputs are validated to ensure accuracy and prevent errors, contributing to a smooth workflow.
2.	Password Management Module
•	This module provides all password functions that include add, edit, delete, display and restore passwords.
•	The module ensures that all data is treated with a well-defined protocol that would greatly help lessen the chances of data destruction.
•	Several measures are put in place to ensure that passwords are not by any chance deleted permanently.
3.	Data Persistence
•	It is important to note that the saved passwords, their respective service name, and the link are saved in a structured format. This makes that data easily accessible and stored in a way that can be accessed by anyone at any time.
•	The system also has features for restoring passwords unless they have been deleted beyond retrieval, providing users with options on the stored data.

B.	Features and Functionalities

1.	Adding a Password
•	To add new passwords the details, include the service, link (for example Facebook or Gmail) and password are typed in. It guarantees users a way to bring together all the password details in one location without much complication.
•	Once the password is added, it is possible to tinker with it using extra operations to the entered data, either to view it, modify, delete it, or restore back.
•	The input process is quite simple without much complex options to complete the required input, and with appropriate guided instructions the users are likely to input the correct information. Such mechanisms are designed to prevent storage of the same record in multiple times or else, where only a part of a record is recorded.
2.	Editing a Password
•	This allows users to modify the password information if the existing data is outdated or were infiltrated by malicious parties. As mentioned before, the system can find a saved password by using the service name or the service link. Depending on their location, users can edit the stored password as they wish.
•	This feature guarantees that users keep all their account credentials current.
•	Added to that is the ‘search’ feature which makes it easy to locate a given password more so in a bulk of password entries. Also, one is unable to overwrite the file by the help of the system, this is because the system offers a pop-up confirmation box when changes are required to be made.
3.	Deleting a Password
•	Another important feature is deleted, where a user can delete a specific password from his/her possibility list. When a password is deleted, the password is not wholly deleted but instead transferred to a directory known as recently deleted. The reason for adopting this precaution is to avoid loss of some data that is sensitive or vital for business in case there is a tragedy.
•	Passwords can be deleted later if required anyway, and it is also beneficial because there is no danger of permanent erasure.
•	Before the deletion is done, the system offers the user a confirmation message to avoid a false action being performed by the user.
4.	Viewing All Passwords
•	This feature presents the quickest way to view all saved passwords with names of services and links to them. It makes users have a privileged and easy way to look at their stored information at once.
•	Selected passwords only are shown on the main view while the deleted passwords are hidden from view to reduce unnecessary confusion to the user. 
•	The layout is clear and structured; users thus do not struggle to find information they require without having to move through various subcategories.
5.	Deleting All Passwords
•	The “Delete All Passwords” function lets customers remove all the saved passwords in one click. It can be helpful to the users who no longer need the system, or the users want to use new system account with new credentials.
•	As for the password deletion, all passwords are transferred to the “Recently Deleted” list so that the user will be able to restore the deleted entries in case of need.
•	Furthermore, it has numerous ways of confirmation to avoid activating this bulk feature for deleting data accidentally.
6.	Restore Deleted Passwords
•	Those passwords, which have been deleted, are not actually deleted but moved to the “Recently Deleted” folder. Users can type the service name or service link to find where this list is to retrieve any lost password.
•	The restoration process is very easy to perform and highly effective for the consumer who has lost important files that were deleted by mistake.
•	This feature helps to give users the sense of security because even after deleting anything that was input in this feature; the user still owns the data.
7.	Erasing Deleted Passwords
•	The “Erase Deleted Passwords” option deletes all entries from the list and there is no way to restore them. Among the passwords, there are the passwords which cannot be restored once they are deleted. This functionality is perfect for users who want to be certain that the information they at one point entered cannot be recovered. 
•	Different from previous steps, this step is accompanied by a warning confirmation indicating that the system is about to perform an irreversible operation. 
•	This is important to make sure user themselves wiped out all the deleted passwords knowing the consequences involved.
